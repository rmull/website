This is a personalized markdown->html personal website generation script that
borrowed from suckless.org's website generator circa 2002. Create directories
and markdown files in the webroot, add the directory names and markdown
filenames to an INCLUDE file in each subdirectory, and run ./generate.sh from
the webroot.
